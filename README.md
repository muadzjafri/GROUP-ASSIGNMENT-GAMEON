Recreational sports such as futsal, badminton, basketball and many more, plays an important role in promoting physical health, social interaction, and community engagement. Despite their popularity, the organization of these activities remains manual and fragmented. Especially when compared to highly digitized industries like transportation and food delivery. Players and organizers still rely on phone calls, spreadsheets, and scattered chat groups to book venues and coordinate games which often lead to inefficiency and miscommunication.

In addressing these challenges, GameOn is proposed as a centralized mobile platform designed to streamline these sports management. The platform will integrate real-time venue booking with a social matchmaking system that allows players to find teams or fill vacant slots easily. By centralizing venue availability, player coordination, and check-in processes into a single application, GameOn aims to create an efficient, reliable and connected recreational sports ecosystem for players, venue operators and sports communities.
